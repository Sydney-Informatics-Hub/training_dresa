"Wearable tecnhology community event","""<p>The Sydney Informatics Hub has encountered researchers working with activity tracking data such as wearable devices, from areas as diverse as life sciences, veterinary science, business, and various arenas of medicine and health.</p><p></p><p>We would like to support the University's researchers to build on synergies in their work. We hope to do this by coordinating symposia where they can present their research around collecting, analysing and modelling physical activity data, in a collegial environment. We would aim to meet up to four times a year, beginning in 2021. This forum will be open to presentations of work in progress or preparation, as well as concluded work. Through creating community we hope to foster interdisciplinary communication and collaboration opportunities, which will speed up the path to high quality and innovative science.</p><p>Location: Virtual attendence via Zoom along with an in person option  H04.02.273.Merewether Building.Merewether Lecture Room (3) 273, 2pm.</p>""","2022-06-07T14:00:00","2022-06-07T15:30:00","Australia/Sydney","in-person","https://www.sydney.edu.au/research/facilities/sydney-informatics-hub/workshops-and-training/training-calendar.html","sih.training@sydney.edu.au","Sydney Informatics Hub","host_institution","University of Sydney","true","Sydney","Australia"

"Multivariate statistical analysis 1 - dimension reduction","""<p><strong>Multivariate Statistical Analysis  1: Dimension Reduction</strong></p><p>In multivariate statistics we simultaneously model and estimate variability in more than one variable often in order to examine the relationship between variables. This workshop examines the key aspects of moving from univariate to multivariate analysis, and the situations and scenarios where multivariate analysis is typically applied. The focus will be on practical application of concepts through examples.</p><p><strong>Topics covered will include:</strong></p><ul><li>Motivations for undertaking multivariate analysis</li><li>Statistical principles for multivariate analysis</li><li>Dimension reduction techniques including principal components analysis (PCA), factor analysis (FA),  correspondence analysis (CA) and non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS)</li></ul><p>This is just one workshop from a modular training programme made up of 1.5 hour workshops, each focusing on a single statistical method offered by Statistical Consulting within the Sydney Informatics Hub. Statistical Workflows giving practical step-by-step instructions applicable in any software are used and include experimental design, exploratory analysis, modelling, assumption testing, model interpretation and presentation of results.  Researchers are encouraged to design a custom programme tailored to their research needs. </p><p><strong>Pre-requisites</strong></p><p>Prior experience with statistical modelling is assumed, as the basics of regression modelling will not be covered. Please consider attending Linear Models 1 and/or Linear Models 2 workshops to come up to speed beforehand. Note that this workshop does not require knowledge of or use of specific statistics software.  The analysis methods may be performed using a wide range of commonly available software.</p><p><strong>Attendance options</strong></p><p>You will get the most out of this session by attending in person.

"A gentle introduction to computer vision","""<p>This is the registration page for SIH's data science short training webinar on an introduction to computer vision and transfer learning, run by the Sydney Informatics Hub. </p><p>***</p><p>Self driving cars. Face recognition. X-Ray, CT and MRI analysis. Digital pathology. These are just the tip of the iceberg of applications for a technology called computer vision.</p><p>We've had cameras and computers for a long time, but now we have the technology to make our computers understand the pictures and videos captured by our cameras. Researchers around the world are competing to develop better and better computer vision algorithms that can understand and make predictions about pictures. One of the most famous models is called YOLO: You Only Look Once. YOLO models have state of the art prediction speed, allowing computers to make extremely fast decisions about images they are seeing.</p><p>From a research perspective, the incredibly exciting thing about many of these models is that we can take algorithms developed by Facebook, Microsoft, Google and the R&D departments of other tech giants, and apply them to completely different datasets that are part of our research. This enables us to build powerful models and tools that we can use to better understand our world - and to publish exciting, high-impact papers. [We'll mention a few case studies of how we've done just this at SIH.]</p><p>In this workshop, we'll show you how you can take a YOLO model that has been trained to solve a problem on one dataset, and then fine tune the model to solve a similar problem but with a totally new dataset. You'll learn the basic concepts behind computer vision and transfer learning, and will be shown how to use industry leading open source tools in Python, including Pytorch and torchvision, and how to use them on cloud computing virtual environments so that you can get access to powerful CUDA enabled GPUs to accelerate machine learning.</p><p>***</p><p><strong>Attendance options:</strong></p><p><strong>Online:</strong> This is a Zoom webinar ONLY.
