A gentle introduction to computer vision,"""""""<p>This is the registration page for SIH's data science short training webinar on an introduction to computer vision and transfer learning, run by the Sydney Informatics Hub. </p><p>***</p><p>Self driving cars. Face recognition. X-Ray, CT and MRI analysis. Digital pathology. These are just the tip of the iceberg of applications for a technology called computer vision.</p><p>We've had cameras and computers for a long time, but now we have the technology to make our computers understand the pictures and videos captured by our cameras. Researchers around the world are competing to develop better and better computer vision algorithms that can understand and make predictions about pictures. One of the most famous models is called YOLO: You Only Look Once. YOLO models have state of the art prediction speed, allowing computers to make extremely fast decisions about images they are seeing.</p><p>From a research perspective, the incredibly exciting thing about many of these models is that we can take algorithms developed by Facebook, Microsoft, Google and the R&D departments of other tech giants, and apply them to completely different datasets that are part of our research. This enables us to build powerful models and tools that we can use to better understand our world - and to publish exciting, high-impact papers. [We'll mention a few case studies of how we've done just this at SIH.]</p><p>In this workshop, we'll show you how you can take a YOLO model that has been trained to solve a problem on one dataset, and then fine tune the model to solve a similar problem but with a totally new dataset. You'll learn the basic concepts behind computer vision and transfer learning, and will be shown how to use industry leading open source tools in Python, including Pytorch and torchvision, and how to use them on cloud computing virtual environments so that you can get access to powerful CUDA enabled GPUs to accelerate machine learning.</p><p>***</p><p><strong>Attendance options:</strong></p><p><strong>Online:</strong> This is a Zoom webinar ONLY.

Statistical Model Building,"""""""<p>This workshop examines and illustrates the key aspects and strategies of statistical model building to help you answer your research question, avoid common pitfalls, erroneous models and incorrect conclusions. Appropriate statistical model building will help you to gain knowledge as opposed to simply getting the best prediction (although that can be a goal as well). We will focus on concepts such as variable selection, multi-collinearity, interactions, selecting a model building strategy, comparing models and evaluating models. In general, these concepts are useful for any statistical model building. This workshop will provide generalised linear regression model examples. The focus will be on practical application of concepts so mathematical descriptions will be kept to a minimum. </p><p></p><p><strong>Attendance options:</strong></p><p>You will get the most out of this session by attending in person.

As part of this project, we have adapted with permission a Quotation Tool, developed by the Discourse Processing Lab at Simon Fraser University. </p><p>The <strong>Quotation tool </strong>uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches to extract quotes from large (or small) text datasets, all from the comfort of a web browser. The tool can identify from the sentence ""Apple said that Tim Cook will be in Australia next month."" the phrase ""Tim Cook will be in Australia next month"" as the quote and ""Apple"" as the speaker. It also allows users to extract and visualise additional information right in the web browser, including identifying named entities affiliated with the speakers and in the quotes themselves, such as ""Apple"", ""Tim Cook"" and ""Australia"" in the above example. The tool supports saving the results locally for further analysis, enabling you to gain meaningful insights into your research questions.</p><p>This 1-hour online workshop will be of interest to researchers and HDR students in Linguistics, Business, Law and Science and others who are interested in working with text datasets - <strong>no background knowledge of NLP or coding experience is required.</strong></p><p>You can BYO a small dataset (10-15 texts, stored as one text per file or all texts compressed in a zip file) – or use one of our sample datasets to get started. </p><p>***</p><p>Attendance options:</p><p>Online: This is a Zoom webinar ONLY.

Statistical Model Building,"""""""<p>This workshop examines and illustrates the key aspects and strategies of statistical model building to help you answer your research question, avoid common pitfalls, erroneous models and incorrect conclusions. Appropriate statistical model building will help you to gain knowledge as opposed to simply getting the best prediction (although that can be a goal as well). We will focus on concepts such as variable selection, multi-collinearity, interactions, selecting a model building strategy, comparing models and evaluating models. In general, these concepts are useful for any statistical model building. This workshop will provide generalised linear regression model examples. The focus will be on practical application of concepts so mathematical descriptions will be kept to a minimum. </p><p></p><p><strong>Attendance options:</strong></p><p>You will get the most out of this session by attending in person.

Statistical Model Building,"""""""<p>This workshop examines and illustrates the key aspects and strategies of statistical model building to help you answer your research question, avoid common pitfalls, erroneous models and incorrect conclusions. Appropriate statistical model building will help you to gain knowledge as opposed to simply getting the best prediction (although that can be a goal as well). We will focus on concepts such as variable selection, multi-collinearity, interactions, selecting a model building strategy, comparing models and evaluating models. In general, these concepts are useful for any statistical model building. This workshop will provide generalised linear regression model examples. The focus will be on practical application of concepts so mathematical descriptions will be kept to a minimum. </p><p></p><p><strong>Attendance options:</strong></p><p>You will get the most out of this session by attending in person.

A hands-on guide to Semantic Tagger for your text data analysis,"""""""<p><strong>Better Understand Your Texts by Adding Semantic Tags</strong></p><p>The Australian Text Analytics Platform (ATAP) project is a project that aims to provide researchers with the tools and training for analysing, processing, and exploring text. As part of this project, we have adapted with permission, a Semantic Tagger, developed by the University Centre for Computer Corpus Research on Language (UCREL) at Lancaster University. This tool uses the Python Multilingual UCREL Semantic Analysis System (PyMUSAS) to tag your text data so that you can extract token level semantic tags from your text. In addition to the USAS tags, this tool can also recognize Multi Word Expressions (MWE), i.e., expressions formed by two or more words that behave like a unit such as 'South Australia', and identifies lemmas and Part-of-Speech (POS) tags in the text. For example, in the sentence 'President Joe Biden attended two meetings today,' the tool will tag each token with its semantic tag like this -&gt; 'President Joe Biden': MWE of [Personal names], 'attended': [Participating], 'two': [Number], 'meetings': [Participating] and 'today': [Time: Present; simultaneous]. This tool is available in both English and multi-lingual (Chinese, Italian and Spanish) versions and supports saving the results locally for further analysis, enabling you to gain meaningful insights into your research questions.</p><p>This workshop will be of interest to Researchers and HDR Students in Linguistics, Business, Law, Science, or those who are interested in working with text datasets. No background knowledge of NLP or coding experience is required for this ~1.5 hour long online workshop, to be delivered via Zoom. You can BYO a small dataset (10-15 texts, stored as one text per file or all texts compressed in a zip file) or use one of our sample datasets to get started. </p><p><em>It is recommended to have a dual monitor setup to view and participate remotely in the session.

Statistical Model Building,"""""""<p>This workshop examines and illustrates the key aspects and strategies of statistical model building to help you answer your research question, avoid common pitfalls, erroneous models and incorrect conclusions. Appropriate statistical model building will help you to gain knowledge as opposed to simply getting the best prediction (although that can be a goal as well). We will focus on concepts such as variable selection, multi-collinearity, interactions, selecting a model building strategy, comparing models and evaluating models. In general, these concepts are useful for any statistical model building. This workshop will provide generalised linear regression model examples.

Multivariate Statistical Analysis 1: Dimension Reduction,"""""""<p><strong>Multivariate Statistical Analysis  1: Dimension Reduction</strong></p><p>In multivariate statistics we simultaneously model and estimate variability in more than one variable often in order to examine the relationship between variables. This workshop examines the key aspects of moving from univariate to multivariate analysis, and the situations and scenarios where multivariate analysis is typically applied. The focus will be on practical application of concepts through examples.</p><p><strong>Topics covered will include:</strong></p><ul><li>Motivations for undertaking multivariate analysis</li><li>Statistical principles for multivariate analysis</li><li>Dimension reduction techniques including principal components analysis (PCA), factor analysis (FA),  correspondence analysis (CA) and non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS)</li></ul><p>This is just one workshop from a modular training programme made up of 1.5 hour workshops, each focusing on a single statistical method offered by Statistical Consulting within the Sydney Informatics Hub. Statistical Workflows giving practical step-by-step instructions applicable in any software are used and include experimental design, exploratory analysis, modelling, assumption testing, model interpretation and presentation of results.  Researchers are encouraged to design a custom programme tailored to their research needs. </p><p><strong>Pre-requisites</strong></p><p>Prior experience with statistical modelling is assumed, as the basics of regression modelling will not be covered. Please consider attending Linear Models 1 and/or Linear Models 2 workshops to come up to speed beforehand. Note that this workshop does not require knowledge of or use of specific statistics software.  The analysis methods may be performed using a wide range of commonly available software.</p><p><strong>Attendance options</strong></p><p>You will get the most out of this session by attending in person.
